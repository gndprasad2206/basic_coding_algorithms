difference detween POP and OOp

1.In pop the data and procedure are diffrent entities but in oop the both data and procedure are Encapsulation.

2.In pop the main program is divided into sub programs and every sub program have its owm procedure, but in oop the every thing is write in objects and classes.

3.In oop the data security is high,But in pop every method can access the data so data security in pop is low.

    •Object-oriented programming lets you extend a program without having to touch previously tested, working code

    Object-oriented programming provides great flexibility, modularity and reusability through encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism

Inheritance         
Polymorphism
Encapsulation
Abstraction

1.Inheritance   
Deriving new classes from existing classes such that the new classes acquire all the features of existing classes is called inheritance

2.Polymorphism
If one task is performed in different ways, it is known as polymorphism.
example: to convince the customer differently, to draw something, for example, shape, triangle, rectangle, etc.

3.Abstraction
Hiding internal details and showing functionality is known as abstraction. 
Example: phone call, we don't know the internal processing.

4.Encapsulation
Binding (or wrapping) code and data together into a single unit are known as encapsulation. 
Example: a capsule, it is wrapped with different medicines.
